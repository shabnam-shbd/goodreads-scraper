# Goodreads Scraper

A python script for extracting a collection of user ratings for all the books in the read shelf. It also scrapes title, author name, average rating, total number of ratings, total number of reviews, and genres for each book ID.

Since this code is written for a specific HTML structure of the website, any updates to the structure would require modifications to the code.
